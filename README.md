__GitHub Tutorial__

__Step 1: Go to the website :__ https://github.com/

__Step 2: Create a free GitHub account__
To set up a GitHub account, Give a Username, Email, and password, and select Sign up for GitHub.

__Step 3: Create a new repository__
-  A repository is similar to a location or container where stuff is saved. In this instance, we are building a Git repository to store code. 
-  Select New Repository from the + sign dropdown menu.
-  Enter a name in Repository name and click Create Repository.

__Step 4: Commit a change__ 
-  A change can be committed to the README file that is initialized when a new repository is created.
-  Select README.md in the repository list of names .
-  Click the Edit option,represented as a pen, and type some information.
-  Review the changes by clicking Preview, right next to the Edit file.
-  By describing the changes made to the file, create a short commit message below Commit changes.
-  Decide if you want to add the commit to a new branch. If not, then add it to the current branch.
-  Click Propose file change.

You have now created an account on GitHub, a repository, initialized it with a README file, and the first commit on GitHub.com.


__WebStorm__

WebStorm is an IDE(integrated development environment) for JavaScript development and related technologies. It includes intelligent coding assistance, debugging, testing, tracing and profiling, and seamless tool integration. IDE features include VCS, Local history, and Customization.


__GIT and GitHub__

GIT and GitHub are two very different things. Git is a distributed version control system that is free and open source made to manage all types of projects quickly and effectively, from tiny to very large ones. A version control system, or VCS, keeps track of the changes created whereas people and teams work together on projects. With considerable advantages for teams, it is frequently used for both open source and commercial software development. Git permits developers to see the complete timeline of their changes and progression on their projects.

GitHub makes tools that integrate with GIT. GIT can be used without GitHub, but Github cannot be used without using GIT. ‘TaraVault’, ‘BitBucket’, ‘GitBucket’, ‘Gogs’, ‘GitLab’ are some of the alternatives for GitHub. 


__GitHub glossary__

__Branch:__ A branch is a repository's parallel version. You can work without restriction without interfering with the "live" version because it is contained within the repository and has no effect on the primary or main branch.

__Clone:__ A clone is the process of creating a copy of a repository that is stored on your computer as opposed to a website's server. Making a clone allows you to modify the files in your favorite editor and use Git to track changes without being connected to the internet.

__Commit:__ A commit, often known as a "revision," is a single file change (or set of files). Git provides a distinct ID (also known as the "SHA" or "hash") when you make a commit to save your work. This ID enables you to keep track of the precise changes committed, as well as who made them and when. The commit message, which is a concise summary of the changes done, is typically included in commits.

__Fetch:__ By adding modifications from the remote repository to your local working branch using ‘git fetch’, you can avoid committing such changes. Fetching, as opposed to ‘git pull’, lets you examine changes before committing them to your local branch.

__GIT:__ Git is an open source tool for monitoring text file changes. It was created by the creator of the Linux operating system and serves as the foundation upon which GitHub's social network and user experience are built.

__GitHub:__ GitHub is a web based version control platform that facilitates coding by providing a web interface and management tools for collaboration with GIT.
Merge: The modifications from one branch—in the same repository or from a fork—are applied to another branch through merging. This frequently occurs as a "pull request" (which is a request to merge) or through the command line. If there are no conflicting changes, a merge can be performed using a pull request through the GitHub.com web interface, or it can always be performed using the command line.

__Merge conflict:__ A distinction between branches that have been combined. Merge conflicts occur when two persons edit the same file simultaneously but make different modifications to the same line, or when one person modifies the file and the other person deletes it. Before merging the branches, the merge conflict needs to be resolved.

__Push:__ Pushing on GitHub.com refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository. For instance, you can push changes that you make locally so that others can see them.

__Pull:__ When you fetch in changes and merge them, this is referred to as pulling. To keep your local copy current, for example, you'll want to bring in any changes made to the remote file you're both working on.

__Remote:__ An online server, most likely GitHub.com, hosts this particular version of a repository or branch. Changes can be synchronized by connecting remote versions to local clones.

__Repository:__ The most basic component of GitHub is a repository. The simplest way to visualize them is as a project's folder. All of the project files, including the documentation, are kept in a repository, which also keeps track of each file's revision history. Multiple people can collaborate on repositories, which can also be either public or private.
